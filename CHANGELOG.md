## 1.1.0 (In development)
### New Features
* Items can now be removed via index with `ListView.removeAt`
* The scrollbar can now optionally be hidden when there are no items to display by passing `hideWhenEmpty: true` to `setScrollbarEnabled`

### Bug Fixes
* Restored `Listview.remove` after its removal in the 1.0.0 refactor

## 1.0.0 (January 22, 2019)
* First release! :tada:
